KCM Data System Documentation
############################################################

The Mission of the Kenya Coordinating Mechanism (KCM) is to harness the full potential of partners and resources to
fight HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in Kenya and oversight the implementation of the Global Fund grants. This
entails constant review and tracking of performance of the Principal Recipients (PRs) and Sub-Recipients (SRs) entrusted
with management of resources.

The tracking and review of performance is conducted through various structures of KCM, including the Oversight Committee,
and is supported through use of electronic visualization dashboards for programmatic and financial data. The current
KCM Dashboard was designed in 2017 to give a visual display of the most important information needed by decision
makers to monitor progress towards the set objectives. Use of the system empowers managers and decision makers to take
corrective actions to improve program performance.
